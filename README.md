"# DS-Algo-Implementation-Application" 


This applications consists of 3 pages.Initially it allows you to choose amongst "get the binary search tree by preorder along with it's level sum " or "to sort values using quick sort" by taking input values of the nodes.

First Page:
The tree page allows you to input nodes for tree.And then by using those nodes it computes the binary search tree of the given nodes and hence prints a list whose first item is the preorder of the binary search tree and the second item is it's level wise sum.

Second Page:
The sort page allows you to input strings to be sorted using quick sort and print a sorted list.
